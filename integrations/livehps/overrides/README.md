# LiveHPS Override Snapshots

This folder keeps only files that intentionally differ from upstream LiveHPS.

Current overrides:
- `dataset/Livehps_dataset.py`: local override used by scan2sim integration.

For upstream usage, setup, and model details, use:
- `/home/victus/projects/LiveHPS/README.md`
